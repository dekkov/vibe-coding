# 17 Poker Rules

## Overview
17 Poker is a heads-up poker variant played with a reduced deck and special rules. Two players compete over 10 hands, with the winner being the player with the most chips at the end.

## Setup
- **Players**: 2 (heads-up)
- **Starting chips**: 100 per player
- **Match length**: 10 hands
- **Deck**: 17 cards total
  - 4 Aces (one per suit)
  - 4 Kings (one per suit) 
  - 4 Queens (one per suit)
  - 4 Jacks (one per suit)
  - 1 Joker (wild card, no suit)
- **Hand size**: 5 cards per player

## Deck and Cards
- **Ranks**: Ace (highest), King, Queen, Jack (lowest)
- **Suits**: Spades > Hearts > Diamonds > Clubs (for tiebreaking)
- **Joker**: Wild card that can substitute for any rank/suit combination
  - Cannot represent a "10" (no 10s exist in this game)
  - Adopts the suit of the rank it represents for tiebreaking purposes

## Hand Rankings (Highest to Lowest)
1. **Five-of-a-Kind**: Five cards of the same rank (requires Joker)
2. **Four-of-a-Kind**: Four cards of the same rank + one kicker
3. **Full House**: Three cards of one rank + two cards of another rank
4. **Three-of-a-Kind**: Three cards of the same rank + two kickers
5. **Two Pair**: Two cards of one rank + two cards of another rank + one kicker
6. **One Pair**: Two cards of the same rank + three kickers

**Note**: No straights, flushes, or straight flushes exist in this game due to the limited deck composition.

## Tiebreaking
1. Compare primary ranks (e.g., trip rank in full house, pair rank in one pair)
2. Compare secondary ranks where applicable (e.g., pair rank in full house)
3. Compare kickers in descending order
4. If still tied, compare by suit hierarchy: Spades > Hearts > Diamonds > Clubs
5. Joker adopts the suit of the rank it represents for tiebreaking

## Game Flow

### Hand Structure
Each hand consists of:
1. **Ante**: Each player pays 5 chips to the pot
2. **Deal**: 5 cards to each player
3. **Pre-Draw Betting Round**
4. **Draw Phase**: Players may discard and replace cards
5. **Post-Draw Betting Round**
6. **Showdown** (if no fold occurred)

### Turn Order
- **Starting player alternates each hand**:
  - Hand 1: Player 1 starts both betting rounds
  - Hand 2: Player 2 starts both betting rounds
  - Hand 3: Player 1 starts both betting rounds
  - etc.
- **Draw order**: Starting player draws first, then other player

### Betting Rules
- **Structure**: Fixed-limit with increments of 5 chips
- **Minimum bet**: 5 chips
- **Maximum bet per street**: 30 chips (6 × ante)
- **Actions available**:
  - **Check**: Pass action when no bet is outstanding
  - **Bet**: Make the first bet on a street (must be 5)
  - **Call**: Match the current bet
  - **Raise**: Increase the bet by 5 chips (if under the 30 cap)
  - **Fold**: Forfeit the hand (opponent wins the pot)

### Betting Round End Conditions
- Two consecutive checks (when no bet is outstanding)
- A bet/raise is called
- A player folds
- Maximum bet (30) is reached and called

### Draw Phase
- Each player may discard 0-5 cards and receive replacements
- **Draw exhaustion rule**: If the deck has fewer cards than requested:
  - Cap the discard to the number of cards remaining in deck
  - Player still ends with exactly 5 cards
- Turn order follows starting player order

### Showdown
- Compare hands using ranking and tiebreaking rules
- Winner takes the entire pot
- Chips are updated immediately

## Match End
- After 10 hands are complete
- Winner is the player with the most chips
- In case of exact tie (highly unlikely), declare a draw

## Special Situations

### Fold
- If a player folds at any point, opponent immediately wins the pot
- Proceed to next hand

### All-In
- If a player has fewer than the required bet/call amount, they go all-in
- Side pots are not applicable in heads-up play

### Deck Exhaustion During Draw
- First player draws normally (up to 5 cards)
- Second player's draw is capped by remaining deck size
- Both players must end with exactly 5 cards

## Example Hand Types with Joker

### Five-of-a-Kind
- A♠ A♥ A♦ A♣ Joker → Five Aces (Joker as A♠ for tiebreaking)

### Four-of-a-Kind  
- K♠ K♥ K♦ Joker A♠ → Four Kings with Ace kicker (Joker as K♣)

### Full House
- Q♠ Q♥ Joker J♠ J♥ → Queens full of Jacks (Joker as Q♦)

### Royal Flush
**Note**: Royal Flush is not possible in this game since there are no 10s, and the Joker cannot represent a 10.
