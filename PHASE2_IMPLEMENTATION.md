# Phase 2: Multiplayer Implementation

## âœ… Completed Features

### Backend Updates

1. **Per-Player Game Views**
   - Modified `GameRoomService.BroadcastGameState()` to send personalized views to each player
   - Opponent cards are masked (null rank/suit) until showdown
   - Each player only sees their own hand during gameplay

2. **Auto-Advance to Next Hand**
   - After a hand completes, server schedules auto-advance in 5 seconds
   - Players can cancel auto-advance via `CancelAutoAdvance` hub method
   - Timer automatically cleans up after firing

3. **SignalR Hub Enhancements**
   - Added `CancelAutoAdvance` hub method
   - Updated `JoinRoom` to send personalized initial game state
   - All game state broadcasts now use per-player views

4. **Room Lifecycle**
   - 3-minute inactivity cleanup sends "RoomTerminated" event
   - Collision-free 6-character room codes (alphanumeric, no confusing chars)
   - Room list updates broadcast to all clients

### Frontend Implementation

1. **SignalR Client Hook (`useGameHub`)**
   - Manages SignalR connection lifecycle
   - Handles all server events (room creation, join, game state, etc.)
   - Provides methods for: createRoom, joinRoom, leaveRoom, setReady, sendAction, cancelAutoAdvance
   - Auto-reconnect on connection loss

2. **Lobby Page (`/lobby`)**
   - Username entry (required, 2+ chars)
   - Create new room button
   - Join room by code input (6-char code)
   - Active rooms list with join buttons
   - Real-time room list updates (every 5s)
   - Redirects to room page when joined

3. **Room Page (`/room/[roomId]`)**
   - Waiting room with ready button (before game starts)
   - Room code display with leave button
   - GameTable component integration
   - Auto-advance countdown with cancel button
   - Match result display
   - Error handling with auto-redirect to lobby on room termination
   - All game actions wired to SignalR hub methods

4. **Card Masking**
   - Updated `Card` component to show card backs (ðŸ‚ ) when rank/suit are null
   - Opponent cards hidden during gameplay
   - Cards revealed at showdown (backend sends full hands)

5. **UI Enhancements**
   - Player names display (from username)
   - Room status indicators (Waiting/InProgress/Complete)
   - Auto-advance countdown UI (5-4-3-2-1)
   - Match completion screen with winner stats
   - Error notifications with auto-dismiss

### Configuration

- **Hub URL**: `http://localhost:5169/gamehub`
- **API URL**: `http://localhost:5169`
- Configure via environment variables:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUB_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`

### User Flow

1. Navigate to `/lobby`
2. Enter username
3. Create room OR join via code OR select from active rooms list
4. Wait in room, click "Ready" when both players present
5. Game starts automatically when both players ready
6. Play game with real-time updates
7. After each hand completes:
   - See showdown results
   - Auto-advance in 5 seconds (or cancel and advance manually)
8. Match complete screen shows winner
9. Return to lobby

### Key Technical Decisions

- **SignalR over polling**: Real-time bidirectional communication, built-in reconnection
- **Per-player views**: Server sends different payloads to each connection (privacy)
- **Auto-advance with override**: UX convenience with manual control
- **Card masking at backend**: Security (client never receives opponent hands until showdown)
- **Room cleanup**: Prevents stale rooms from accumulating
